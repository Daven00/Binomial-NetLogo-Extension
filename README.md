# Binomial-NetLogo-Extension
a NetLogo extension for binomial distributions.

The binomial extension provides just one statistical function for data generated within NetLogo models. stats extension[1] contains the majority of statistical functions and it includes data manipulation of binomial distributions as well. Nevertheless this extension has been developed to deal with an uncommon circumstance:  nd the success probability (p) of a binomial distribution given the number of trials (n), the number of successes (k) and the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF or F (k; n; p)).

This extension is written in Java and eased by the use of Commons Math[2] library and Symbolic Methods[3].
